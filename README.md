## Getting started

Please start with Get_Started.mlx

## Outline

+ Hands-on on simple Simscape gas model - Concepts & Ergonomy
+ Ideal power source modeling - Analysis and automation 
+ Implement power limitation and dynamics - Model parametrization 
+ Get closer to the technology with Simscape Fluids - Dedicated ready-to-use components 
+ Describe physics and capture equations with Simscape Language 
+ System level model of a fuel cell - Multidomain hybrid simulation 

## Introduction 

Why are we building a model ? To provide answers to design engineering questions that might be:
+ Explore and sort among competing systems architecture
+ Size the components of your system 
+ Evaluate integration of components of your system, check for multiphysic interactions
+ Design and calibrate controller leveraging desktop-simulation and real-time testing
+ Fault analysis: perform nominal and dysfunctionnal simulation of your system
+ Optimize the operations of your systems leveraging digital twins

## Wrap-up 
+ Why are we building a model ? 
+ Simscape makes it possible to capture multiple levels of abstraction of a given system
